If the current number against that ID is even, it will add 3 to the number, otherwise, it will add 1 to the number. - While that is happening, a cron job should go through all the existing IDs and remove IDs that have a count of greater than 10 and are currently an even number (including 10). - Write tests to make sure your API and cronjob work",
